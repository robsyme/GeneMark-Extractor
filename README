Problem:
GeneMark will predict genes and output their locations in a gtf2 file.
We want two convert this into a gff3 format file.
It would also be nice to have a tool that pulls out the relevant sequences from the original fasta file.

A full gff3 format description can be found here: http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml
There is a gff3 validator at: http://dev.wormbase.org/db/validate_gff3/validate_gff3_online

It is important that the gff file retains information about start and stop sites.
We want to know which gene models are complete so that we can qualify any secretion peptide predictions.
